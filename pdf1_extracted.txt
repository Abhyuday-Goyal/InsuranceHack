questions regarding whether services are covered.

THIS IS AN HMO EOC 
That means this EOC  does not provide benefits for any services you receive from an Out -of-Network Provider 
except:  
 Services for Stabilization and initial treatment of an  Emergency  Medical Condition, or  
 Medically Necessary services that are not available through an In- Network Provider . 
In-Network Providers include Physician s, Hospitals, and O ther Health Care Facilities. Check the P rovider 
directory, available at www. mycigna.com, or call the number on your ID card to determine if a Provider is In-
Network.   
 
Choosing a Primary Care Physician (PCP)  
A Primary Care Physician  may serve an important role in meeting health care  needs by providing or 
arranging for medical care for each Member . For this reason, w hen you enroll as a Member , you will be 
asked to select a Primary Care Physician  (PCP). Your PCP will provide your regular medical care and assist 
in coordinating your care . You may select your PCP by calling the customer service phone number on your 
ID card or by visiting Our website at www.mycigna.com. The Primary Care Physician Y ou select for 
Yourself may be different from the Primary Care Physician Y ou select for each of Y our Family Member(s).  
You have the right to designate any Primary Care Physician who participates in Our network for this plan 
and is available to accept You or Your Family Members.  If you do not choose a PCP, We may  select a PCP 
for you. 
 
 
Referrals to Specialists  
Your PCP must provide a Referral before you may visit any Provider other than y our PCP in order for the 
visit to be covered.  The R eferral authorizes the specific number of visits that y ou may make to a Provider 
within a specified period of time.  If you receive treatm ent from a Provider other than y our PCP without a 
Referral from your PCP, the treatment is not covered.  
Exceptions to the Referral process:  
If you are a female Member, you may visit a qualified Participating Provider for covered obstetrical and 
gynecological services, as defined in “Covered Services and Benefits,” without a Referral from y our PCP. 
You do not need a PCP Referral for Virtual Care Services . 
If you are a Member under age 19, y ou may visit a dentist for Pediatric Dental Benefits or a Provider in 
Cigna Healthcare’ s vision network for Pediatric Vision Benefits without a Referral from y our PCP.  
You do not need a R eferral from your PCP for Emergency Services as defined in the “Definitions.”  In the 
event of an emergency, get help immediately.  Go to the nearest emergency room, the nearest hospital or 
call or ask someone to call 911 or y our local emergency service, police or fire department for help. You do 
not need a Referral from y our P CP for Emergency Services, but you do need to call y our PCP as soon as 
possible for further assistance and advice on follow -up care.  
In an emergency, you should seek immediate medical attention and then as soon as possible thereafter you 
need to call y our PCP for further assistance and advice on follow -up care.   
In an Urgent Care situation a Referral is not required but y ou should, whenever  possible, contact y our PCP 
for direction prior to receiving services.  
You may also visit a qualified Participating Provider for covered Pediatric Vision Care Services and Pediatric 
Dental Care Services, as defined in “Covered Services and Benefits”, without a R eferral from your PCP.

3 Standing Referral to Specialist  
You may apply for a standing R eferral to a Provider other than your PCP when all of the following conditions 
apply:  
1. You are a covered Member of the Cigna Healthcare HMO EOC;  
2. You have a disease or condition that is life threatening, degenerative, chronic or disabling;  
3. Your PCP in conjunction with a n etwork specialist determines that your care requires another 
Provider’s expertise;  
4. Your PCP determines that your disease or condition will require ongoing medical care for an 
extended period of time;  
5. The standing r eferral is made by your PCP to a network specialist who will be responsible for 
providing and coordinating your specialty care; and 
6. The network specialist is authorized by Cigna Healthcare to provide the services under the standing 
referral.  
We may limit the number of visits and time period for which you may receive a standing R eferral. A standing 
Referral may be effective for up to 12 months and may be renewed and re- renewed by your PCP. If y ou 
receive a standing Referral or any other Referral from your PCP, that Referral remains in effect even if the 
PCP ceases to be a Participating Physician. If the treating specialist leaves Cigna Healthcare’s network or 
you cease to be a covered Member, the standing R eferral expires.  
 
Changing Primary Care Physicians   
You may voluntarily change y our PCP , but not more than once in any calendar month. We reserve the right 
to determine the number of  times during a plan Year that y ou will be allowed to change y our PCP.  You may 
request a change from one Primary Care Physician to another by going to www. mycigna.com, under 
your name, click on “My Health Team ,” click “Change, ” and follow the directions displayed,  or by 
contacting Us at the customer service number on your ID card.  
In addition, if at any time a Primary Care Physician  ceases to be a Participating Provider, We will notify 
you 30 days in advance, for the purpose of selecting a new Primary Care Physician . 
If Your Physician  Leaves the Network  
If your PCP or specialist ceases to be a Participating Physician , We will notify you in writing of his or her 
impending termination at least 30 days in advance of the date the PCP leaves the network and provide 
assistance in selecting a new PCP or identifying a new specialist to continue providing Covered Services. If 
you do not choose a PCP after being notified that your PCP is no longer a Participating Provider , We may 
select a PCP for you. If you are receiving treatment from a Participating Provider at t he time his or her 
Participating Provider agreement is terminated, for reasons other than medical incompetence or 
professional misconduct, you may be eligible for continued care with that Provider.  
Continuity of Care  
If your PCP , specialist or facility ceas es to be a Participating Provider , We will notify you. Under certain 
medical circumstances, We may continue to reimburse Covered Expenses from your facility, PCP or a 
specialist you’ve been seeing at the Participating Provider benefit level even though he or she is no longer 
affiliated with Cigna  Healthcare's network. If you are undergoing  a course of treatment for a Serious and 
Complex Condition; or undergoing a course of institutional or inpatient care; or scheduled to undergo non-
elective surgery, including receipt of postoperative care with respect to s uch a surgery; or determined to be 
terminally ill and are receiving treatment for such illness,  and continued treat ment is Medically Necessary, 
you may be eligible to receive continuing care from the Non- Participating Provider for a specified time, 
subject to the treating Provider’s agreement. You may also be eligible to receive continuing care if you are

 MIHM0411 MIHM0412 MIHM0414  
4 pregnant and undergoing a course of treatment for the pregnancy, in which case, continued care may be 
extended through your delivery and include a period of postpartum care.  
Such continuity of care must be approved in advance by Cigna Healthcare, and your Provider must agree 
to accept Our reimbursement rate and to abide by Cigna Healthcare’s policies and procedures and quality 
assurance requirements. There may be additional circumstances where continued care by a Provider who 
ceases to be a Participating Provider will not be available, such as when the Provider loses his/her license 
to practice or retires.  
You may request continuity of care from Cigna Healthcare after your Participating Provider’s termination 
from Cigna  Healthcare's network; start by calling the toll -free number on your ID card. Continuity of care 
must be Medically Necessary and approved in advance by Us. Continuity of care will cease upon the earlier 
of:  
 Successful transition of your care to a Participating Provider ; or 
 Completion of your treatment; or  
 The next Annual Open Enrollment Period; or  
 The length of time approved for continuity of care ends.  
 
 
Confined to a Hospital  
If you are confined in a H ospital on the E ffective date of your coverage, you must notify U s of such a 
hospitalization within two (2) days, or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter. When y ou are enrolled as 
a Member , you agree to permit Cigna Healthcare to assume direct coordination of y our health care.  We 
reserve the right to transfer y ou to the care of a Participating Provider and/or Part icipating Hospital if Cigna 
Healthcare, in consultation with y our attending Physician, determines that it is medically safe to do so.  
If you are hospitalized on the Effective Date of coverage and you fail to notify U s of this hospitalization, 
refuse to permit Us to coordinate your care, or refuse to be transferred to the care of a Participating Provider 
or Participating Hospital, W e will not be obligated to pay for any medical or Hospital expenses that are 
related to y our hospitalization following the first two (2) days after your coverage begins.

eligible for benefits.  FAILURE TO OBTAIN PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PRIOR TO CERTAIN ELECTIVE

to be Medically Necessary, benefits will be provided as described in this EOC . If it is determined that a 
service was not Medically Necessary, Cigna Healthcare will not cover any Charges for that service.

When Can I Apply?  
Application to Enroll or Change Coverage  
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) specifies that an eligible person must enroll 
for coverage or change plans during the Annual Open E nrollment Period. Persons who fail to enroll or change 
plans during the Annual Open Enrollment Period must wait until the next Annual Open Enrollment Period to 
enroll in a plan or to change plans. However, if a person experiences a triggering event as described below, 
the tr iggering event starts a special enrollment period during which an eligible person can enroll and a 
Subscriber  can add dependents  and change coverage.  
The Annual Open Enrollment Period and s pecial enrollment period are explained below.  
 
Annual Open Enrollment Period

coverage under this EOC  for Yourself and any eligible d ependent(s), and We must receive that application 
during the Annual Open Enrollment Period.

for that Year’s Annual O pen Enrollment Period.  Note: If You do not  apply to obtain or change coverage 
during the Annual Open Enrollment Period, You will not be able to apply again until the following 
Year’s Annual Open Enrollment Period unless You qualify for a special enrollment period as described 
below.  
 
Special Enrollment Periods  
A special enrollment period occurs when a person experiences a triggering event.

44 How the EOC  Works  
 
Note: Services performed by a Non-Participating (an Out -of-Network ) Provider are not covered under 
this EOC except for Emergency Services and as shown in the section titled “Special Circumstances.”  
 
Benefit Schedule  
The benefit schedule shows the Individual and Family Deductible and Out -of-Pocket Maximums, and the 
maximum Covered Expense for each type of benefit.  
No benefits are payable unless the Member ’s coverage is in force at the time services are rendered, and the 
payment of benefits is subject to all the terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions of this  EOC . 
In addition, no benefits are payable unless the Member receives services from a Participating Provider, except 
as indicated below under “Special Circumstances .” 
 
Participating Hospitals, Participating Physicians and Other Participating Providers 
Covered Expenses for services provided by Participating Providers are based on Our Negotiated Rate. 
Participating Providers have agreed NOT to charge more than the Cigna Healthcare Negotiated Rates for 
Covered Services.  Participating Providers may charge the Member for services that are not Covered Services 
under the EOC . In addition, Participating Providers will file claims with Us for the Member , and will request 
Prior Authorization when it is required.  
Be sure to check with the P rovider prior to an appointment to verify that the P rovider is currently 
contracted with Cigna Healthcare . 
Special Circumstances  
This EOC does not cover Charges  incurred for services provided by Non -Participating Providers except in 
the limited situations described below. Your cost -sharing for Covered Expenses incurred for the services 
of a Non- Participating Provider in these special circumstances is indicated in the benefit schedule.  
 
You will be responsible for only the amount of Non- Participating Provider Covered Expenses that you would 
have incurred if you received the services from an In- Network Provider. We will ensure that you are held 
harmless for any amounts beyond the Copayment , Deductible and Coinsurance percentage You would 
have paid had you received the services from a Participating Provider.  We will provide you with an 
explanation of benefits and request that you notify us if the Non- Participating Provider bills you for amounts 
beyond the amount paid by us. We will then resolve any amounts the Non -Participating Provider bills you 
beyond the amount paid by us, consistent with you being held harmless for any amounts beyond what you 
would have paid for the same services from a Participating Provider.  
 Emergency Services  
Covered Expenses incurred for  the treatment of an Emergency Medical Condition provided in the 
emergency department of a Non- Participating Hospital or of an independent freestanding emergency 
facility are paid as described in the benefit schedule.  Any expenses incurred for services of a Non -
Participating Provider after  the patient is  Stabilized and his/her condition permits transfer to a 
Participating Hospital and/or to the care of a Participating Provider  are not covered, except as stated 
in the Other Circumstances section below.  
 Other Circumstances  
Covered Expenses for non- emergency, Medically Necessary services of a Non- Participating Provider 
will be paid according to the Participating Provider Cost Share shown in the b enefit schedule in the 
following cases:  
o when you have a referral from your Participating (PCP) to a Non- Participating Provider; or   
Cigna HealthCare of Illinois, Inc.  
INDHMOIL c01-2024  Connect Silver CMS Standard  
 MIHM0411 MIHM0412 MIHM0414  
45 o when ancillary services from a Non- Participating Provider are provided in a Participating facility, 
or

For immunosuppressant drugs, if the prescribing Physician has indic ated on the Prescription Order “may 
not substitute” , a pharmacist may not interchange another immunosuppressant drug or formulation without 
notification and the documented consent of the prescribing Physician and the Member, or the parent or 
guardian if the Member is a child, or the spouse of the Member who is authorized to consent to the treatment  
of the Member. This does not apply to medication orders issued for immunosuppressant drugs during in-
patient care in a licensed Hospital.  
Your responsibility for covered Prescription Drugs and Related Supplies will always be the lowest of:  
 the Copay ment  or Coinsurance  for the Prescription Drug;  or 
 Cigna Healthcare’ s discounted rate for the Prescription Drug; or  
 the Pharmacy’s Usual and Customary (U&C) charge for the Prescription Drug.  
Usual & Customary (U&C) means the established Pharmacy retail cash price, less all applicable 
customer discounts that Pharmacy usually applies to its customers, regardless of the customer’s 
payment source.

Split Fill Dispensing Program  
This program applies for the first 30 days when you start a new therapy on certain Limited Distribution Drugs 
and Specialty Medications . The split fill dispensing program is designed to prevent wasted Prescription Drugs 
if your Prescription Drug or dose changes. The Prescription Drugs that are included under this program have 
been identified as requiring more frequent follow up to monitor response to treatment and reactions. You will 
initially get up to a 15- day supply of your Prescription Order for certain drugs filled at Accredo or Express 
Scripts, Our home delivery Pharmacy instead of the full Prescription Order. You pay half the 30- day Cost  
Share for this initial 15- day supply, and would be responsible for the other half of the 30- day Cost Share if an 
additional 15- day supply is provided. The therapeutic classes of Prescription Drugs that are included in this 
program are determined by Cigna Healthcare and will be managed for continuation in this program as new 
clinical guidelines and dispensing experience dictates.

80 Prescription Drug List Management  
The Prescription Drug List is managed by the Health Plan Value Assessment Committee (HVAC) , which 
makes, subject to the P&T Committee’s review and approval of the Prescription Drug List, coverage tier 
placement decisions of Prescription Drugs or Related Supplies and/or applies utilization management 
requirements to certain Prescription Drugs or  Related Supplies. Your EOC ’s coverage tiers may contain 
Prescription Drugs or Related Supplies that are Generic Drugs, Brand Name Drugs or Specialty 
Medications. Placement of any Prescription Drug or Related Supplies in a specific tier, and application of 
utilization management requirements to a Prescription Drug, depends on a number of clinical and economic 
factors.  Clinical factors include, without limitation, the P&T Committee’s evaluations of the place in therapy, 
or relative safety or relative efficacy of the Prescription Drug or Related Supplies, and economic factors 
include, without limitation, the cost and/or available rebates for Prescription Drugs or Related Supplies.  
Whether a particular Prescription Drug or Related Suppl y is appropriate for You or any of Your Family 
Member(s), regardless of its eligibility coverage under Your EOC , is a determination that is made by You (or 
Your Family Member) and the prescribing Physician.   
The coverage status of a Prescription Drug or Related Supply may change periodically during the Year for 
various reasons. For example, a Prescription Drug or Related Supply may be removed from the market, a 
new Prescription Drug in the same therapeutic class may become available, or the cost of a Prescription 
Drug or Related Supply may increase.  
As a result of coverage changes, you may be required to pay more or less for that Prescription Drug or 
Related Supply, or try another covered Prescription Drug or Related Supply.  Please access 
www.mycigna.com  through the Internet or call Customer Service at the telephone number on your ID card 
for the most up -to-date coverage tier status, utilization management, or other coverage limitations for 
Prescription Drugs or Related Supplies.  
 
Covered Expenses  
If a Member , while covered under this EOC , incurs expenses for charges made by a Pharmacy for Medically 
Necessary Prescription Drugs or Related Supplies ordered by a Physician, Cigna Healthcare will provide 
coverage for those expenses as shown in the benefit schedule. Coverage also includes Medically Necessary 
Prescription Drugs and Related Supplies dispensed for a P rescription issued to You or Your Family 
Members by a licensed dentist for the prevention of infection or pain in conjunction with a dental procedure.  
When You or Your Family Members are issued a Prescription for Medically Necessary Prescription Drugs 
or Related Supplies as part of the rendering of Emergency Services and that P rescription cannot reasonably 
be filled by a Participating Pharmacy, the P rescription will be covered by Cigna Healthcare as if filled by a 
Participating Pharmacy.  
Patient Assurance Program  
Your EOC offers additional discounts for certain covered Prescription Drugs that are dispensed by a 
Pharmacy included in what is known as the “Patient Assurance Program .” As may be described elsewhere 
in this EOC, from time to time Cigna Healthcare may enter into arrangements with pharmaceutical 
manufacturers for discounts that result in a reduction of your out of pocket expenses for certain covered 
Prescription Drugs for which Cigna Healthcare earns the discounts.  Specifically, some or all of the Patient 
Assurance Program discount earned by Cigna Healthcare for certain covered Prescription Drugs included 
in the Patient Assurance Program is applied or credited to a portion o f your  Copayment or Coinsurance, if 
any.  The Copayment or Coinsurance, if any, otherwise applicable to those certain covered Prescription 
Drugs as set forth in the benefit schedule may be reduced in order for Patient Assurance Program discounts 
or other payments  earned by Cigna Healthcare to be applied or credited to the  Copayment or Coinsurance, 
if any, as described above.

 MIHM0411 MIHM0412 MIHM0414  
81 For example, certain insulin drugs covered under the Prescription Drug benefit for which Cigna Healthcare  
earns a discount in connection with the Patient Assurance Program may result in a credit toward some or 
all of your  Copayment or Coinsurance, if any, which, as noted, may be reduced from the amount set forth 
in the benefit schedule, for the insulin drugs.  In addition, the covered insulin drugs eligible for Patient 
Assurance Program discounts may not be subject to any applicable Deductible, if any.  
Any Patient Assurance Program discount that is used to satisfy your  Copayment or Coinsurance, if any, for 
covered Prescription Drugs under the Patient Assurance Program applies toward your Out -of-Pocket 
Maximum.  
Please note that the Patient Assurance Program discounts that Cigna Healthcare may earn for Prescription 
Drugs, and may apply or credit to your  Copayment or Coinsurance, if any, in connection with the Patient 
Assurance Program are unrelated to any rebates or other payments that Cigna Healthcare may earn from 
a pharmaceutical manufacturer for the same or other Prescription Drugs. Except as may be noted elsewhere 
in this EOC, you are not entitled to the benefit of those rebates or other payments earned by Ci gna 
Healthcare because they are unrelated to the Patient Assurance Program.  Additionally, the availability of 
the Patient Assurance Program, as well as the Prescription Drugs included in the Patient Assurance 
Program and/or your  Copayment or Coinsurance, if any for those eligible Prescription Drugs, may change 
from time to time depending on factors including, but not limited to, the continued availability of the Patient 
Assurance Program discount(s) to Cigna Healthcare in connection with the Patient Assur ance Program.  
More information about the Patient Assurance Program , including the Prescription Drugs included in the 
program, is available at the website shown on your ID card or by calling Customer Service at the telephone

Supplemental Drug Discount P rogram  
You are responsible for paying 100% of the cost for any Prescription Drugs or Related Supplies excluded 
by this plan. However, the Supplemental Drug Discount Program allows P articipating Pharmacies to 
charge Members the discounted cost of non- covered Prescription Drugs and Related Supplies. This 
means you will pay 100% of the discounted cost, rather than the full cost, of Prescription Drugs and 
Related Supplies the plan does not cover. Please n ote: the out -of-pocket costs that You and Your Family 
Member(s) pay for any Prescription Drugs or Related Supplies the plan does not cover will not be applied 
to the Member’s Deductible or Out -of-Pocket Maximum.  
Authorization, Exception and Appeal Process for Prescription Drugs and Related Supplies  
Authorization from Cigna Healthcare is required for certain Prescription Drugs and Related Supplies, 
meaning that your Physician must obtain A uthorization from Cigna Healthcare before the Prescription Drug 
or Related Supply will be covered.

Specialty Medications, Cigna Healthcare requires your Physician to obtain Authorization before the 
Prescription or supply can be filled. To obtain Prior Authorization, your Physician must follow the Prescription 
Drug and Related Supply Authorization and Exception Request Process as described below.  
 
Step Therapy  
Step Therapy  is a type of Prior Authorization. Cigna Healthcare may require a Member  to follow certain 
steps before covering some Prescription Drugs and Related Supplies, including without limitation, some 
higher -cost and Specialty Medications. If a Prescription Drug  or Related Supply is subject to a Step Therapy 
requirement, then  you must try one or more similar Prescription Drugs  and Related Supplies  before the EOC 
will cover the requested Prescription Drug  or Related Supply. The Prescription Drugs  and Related Supplies 
that require Step Therapy can be identified on the Prescription Drug List at http://www.cigna.com/ifp -drug-
list.  To obtain Step Therapy Authorization, your Physician must follow the Prescription Drug and Related 
Supply Authorization and Exception Request Process as described below.

Process as described below.  
 
Prescription Drug and Related Supply Authorization and Exception Request Process

Healthcare’ s Prescription Drug List. The expedited review will be reviewed and completed by Cigna 
Healthcare within 24 hours of receipt.  
If the request is approved, y our Physician will receive confirmation. The Authorization/Exception will be 
processed in Cigna Healthcare ’s pharmacy claim system to allow y ou to have coverage for those 
Prescription Drugs or Related Supplies. The length of the Authorization will be granted until y ou no longer 
use the Prescription Drug or Related Supply for which the Authorization or Exception was approved. 
When your Physician advises y ou that coverage for the Prescription Drugs or Related Supplies has been 
approved, you should contact the Pharmacy to fill the Prescription(s).

or Related Supplies was not authorized.

90 General Provisions  
Third Party Liability   
You agree to advise Us, in wr iting, within a reasonable time of your claim against the third party and to take 
such action, provide such information and assistance, and execute such documents as We may reasonably 
require to facilitate enforcement of the claim. You also agree to take no action that may prejudice the rights 
or interes ts of Us under this EOC . Failure to provide notice of a claim or to cooperate with Us, or actions 
that prejudice our rights or interests, may be considered to be a material breach by Us and may subject you 
to legal action.  
In addition, if a Member  incurs expenses for Illness or Injury that occurred due to the negligence of a third 
party:  
 We have the right to reimbursement for all benefits W e paid from any and all damages collected from the 
third party for those same expenses whether by action at law, settlement, or compromise, by the Member , 
Member ’s parents, if the Member  is a minor, or Member ’s legal representative as a result of that Illness 
or Injury; and  
 We are assigned the right to recover from the third party, or his or her insurer, to the extent of the benefits 
We paid for that Illness or Injury.  
 We shall have the right to first reimbursement out of all funds the Member , the Member ’s parents, if the 
Member  is a minor, or the Member ’s legal representative, is or was able to obtain for the same expenses 
We have paid as a result of that Illness or Injury.  
You are required to furnish any information or assistance or provide any documents that we may reasonably 
require in order to obtain Our rights under this provision.  This provision applies whether or not the third party 
admits liability.  
 
Alternate Cost Containment Provision  
We may, in certain situations, approve services under an alternate treatment plan. An alternate treatment plan 
may include services or supplies otherwise limited or excluded by the EOC . The alternate treatment plan must 
be mutually agreed to by Us, the Member , and the Physician , Provider, or other healthcare practitioner. Our 
offering an alternate treatment plan in a particular case in no way commits Us to do so in another case, nor 
does it prevent Us from strictly applying the express benefits, limitations, and exclusions of the EOC  at any 
other time or for the Member . 
Coordination of Benefits  
This section describes what this EOC will pay for Covered Expenses that are also covered under one 
or more other plans. You should file all claims with each plan. 
 
Definitions  
For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings set forth below:  
Plan  
Any of the following that provides benefits in the form of payment or services for:  
 An insurance p lan issued to an individual/non- group or a group; or a self -insured group health plan 
providing benefits in the form of reimbursement or services for medical care or treatment/items.   
 Governmental benefits as permitted by law, except for Medicaid, Medicare and Medicare supplement 
policies.  
 Medical benefits coverage under any form of group or individual automobile insurance.   
Cigna HealthCare of Illinois, Inc.  
INDHMOIL c01-2024  Connect Silver CMS Standard  
 MIHM0411 MIHM0412 MIHM0414  
91 Each plan or part of a plan which has the right to coordinate ben efits will be considered a separate plan. 
 
Primary Plan  
The plan that pays first as determined by the Order of Benefit Determination Rules below.  
 
Secondary Plan  
The plan that pays after the Primary Plan as determined by the Order of Benefit Determination Rules 
below. The benefits under the Secondary Plan are reduced based on the benefits under the Primary Plan.  
 
Allowable Expense  
The porti on of a Covered Expense used in determining the benefits this p lan pays when it is the Secondary 
Plan. The Allowable Expense is the lesser of:  
 the charge used by the Primary Plan in determining the benefits it pays;  
 the charge that would be used by this p lan in determining the benefits it would pay if it were the Primary 
Plan; and  
 the amount of the Covered Expense.  
If the benefits for a Covered Expense under your Primary Plan are reduced because you did not comply 
with the Primary Plan’s requirements (for  example, getting pre- certification of H ospital admission or a 
second surgical opinion), the amount of the Allowable Expense is reduced by the amount of the 
reduction.  
 
Claim Determination Period  
A Calendar Year, but does not include any part of a year du ring which y ou are not covered under this p lan 
or any date before this sec tion or any similar provision takes effect.  
 
Order of Benefit Determination Rules  
A plan that does not have a coordination of benefits rule consi stent with this section shall always be the 
Primary Plan. If the plan does have a coordination of benefits rule  consistent with this sec tion, the first 
of the following rules that applies to the situation is the one that applies:  
 The plan that covers you as an enrollee or an employee shall be the Primary Plan and the plan that 
covers you as a d ependent shall be the Secondary Plan.  
 If you are a d ependent child whose parents are not divorced or legally separated, the Primary Plan shall 
be the plan which covers the parent whose birthday falls first in the Calendar Year as an enrollee or 
employee.  
 If you are the dependent of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the dependent shall be determined 
in the following order:  
o first, if a court decree states that one parent is responsible for the child’ s healthcare expenses or 
health coverage and the plan for that parent has actual knowledge of the terms of the order, but 
only from the time of actual knowledge;  
o then, the p lan of the parent with custody of the child;  
o then, the p lan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child;  
o then, the p lan of the parent not having custody of the child;  and 
o finally, the p lan of the spouse of the parent not having custody of the child.  
 The plan that covers y ou as an activ e employee (or as that employee’ s dependent) shall be the Primary 
Plan and the p lan that covers y ou as a laid-off or retired employee (or as that employee’ s dependent)  
Cigna HealthCare of Illinois, Inc.  
INDHMOIL c01-2024  Connect Silver CMS Standard  
 MIHM0411 MIHM0412 MIHM0414  
92 shall be the S econdary Plan. If the other p lan does not have a similar provision and, as a result, the p lans 
cannot agree on the order of benefit determination, this paragraph shall not apply.  
 The plan that covers you under a right of continuation which is provided by federal or state law shall be 
the Secondary Plan and the p lan that covers y ou as an active employee or retiree (or as that employee’ s 
dependent) shall be the Primary Plan. If the other p lan does not have a similar provision and, as a result, 
the plans cannot agree on the order of benefit determination, this paragraph shall not apply.  
 If one of the p lans that covers y ou is issued out of the state whose laws govern this p lan, and determines 
the order of benefits based upon the gender of a parent, and as a result, the plans do not agree on the 
order of benefit determination, the p lan with the gender rules shall determine the order of benefits.  
If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the p lan that has covered you for the longer 
period of time shall be primary.  
 
Effect on the Benefits Payable  
 If this p lan is the Primary Plan, the amount this p lan pays for Covered Expenses  will be determined without 
regard for the benefits payable under any other p lan. 
 If this p lan is the Secondary Plan, the amount this p lan pays for Covered Expenses  is the Allowable 
Expense less the amount paid by the Primary P lan during a Claim Determination Period.  
If while covered under this plan, you are also covered by another Cigna Healthcare individual or group plan, 
you will be entitled to the benefits of only one p lan. You may choose this p lan or the p lan under which y ou will 
be covered. Cigna Healthcare will then refund any Premium received under the other plan covering the time 
period both policies were in effect. However, any claim payments made by Cigna Healthcare under the plan 
you elected to cancel will be deducted from any such refund of P remium.  
 
Recovery of Excess Benefits  
If this plan is the Secondary Plan and Cigna Healthcare pays for Covered Expenses that should have 
been paid by the Primary Plan, or if Cigna Healthcare pays any amount in excess of what it is obligated 
to pay, Cigna Healthcare will have the right to recover the actual overpayment made. Cigna Healthcare 
will have sole discretion to seek such recovery from any person to, or for whom, or with respect to whom, 
such services were provided or such payments made by any insurance company, healthcare plan or 
other organization. If W e request, y ou must execute and deliver to U s such instruments a nd documents 
as We determine are necessary to s ecure the right of recovery.  
 
Right to Receive and Release Information  
Cigna Healthcare , without consent or notice to you, may obtain information from and release information 
to any other p lan with respect to y ou in order to c oordinate your benefits pursuant to this section. You 
must provide Us with any information We request in order to coordinate y our benefits pursuant to this 
section. This request may occur in connection with a submitted claim; if so, you will be advised that the 
“other coverage” information, (including an e xplanation of b enefits paid under the Primary Plan) is 
required before the claim will be processed for payment. If no response is received within 55 days of 
the request, the claim will be denied. If the requested information is subsequently received, the claim 
will be pro cessed.  
 
Medicare E nrollment  
If a Member  is enrolled in Medicare, Cigna Healthcare will calculate the claim payment for Covered 
Services according to the benefit levels of this EOC  based on the allowed amount defined below, and 
pay this amount minus any amount paid by Medicare. A person is considered enrolled in Medicare on 
the earliest date any coverage under Medicare becomes effective for him/her.  In no event will the 
amount paid exceed the amount that Cigna Healthcare would have paid if it were the sole insurance 
carrier.

 MIHM0411 MIHM0412 MIHM0414  
93 Under this scenario, the allowed amount will be the lesser of:  
 The amount Medicare allowed; or  
 Cigna Healthcare’s Negotiated Rate for a Participating Provider; or  
 Cigna Healthcare’ s Allowed Expense for a Non -Participating Provider.

If the appeal involves a coverage decision based on issues of Medical Necessity, clinical appropriateness 
or experimental treatment, a medical review will be conducted by a Physician reviewer in the same or similar 
specialty as the care under consideration, as determined by Cigna Healthcare’s Physician reviewer. For all 
other coverage plan- related appeals, a review will be conducted by someone who was a) not involved in 
any previous decision related to Y our appeal, and b) not a subordinate of previous decision makers. Provide 
all relevant documentation with Y our appeal request.  
 
We will acknowledge in writing that W e have received Y our request. For required preservice and concurrent 
care coverage determinations, Cigna Healthcare ’s review will be completed within 15 calendar days. For 
post service claims, Cigna Healthcare’s review will be completed within 15 business  days. If more time or 
information is needed to make the determination, We will notify the Member in writing to request an extension 
of up to 15 calendar days and to specify any additional information needed by Us to com plete the review. In 
the event any new or additional information (evidence) is considered, relied upon or generated by Us in 
connection with the appeal, we will provide this information to Y ou as soon as possible and sufficiently in 
advance of the decision, so that You will have an opportunity to respond. Also, if any new or additional

The Member will be notified in writing of the decision within 5 working days after the decision is made, and 
within the review time frames above if Cigna Healthcare does not approve the requested coverage.  
 
 
Expedited Appeal  
You can file an expedited appeal orally or in writing if:  
a) the time frames under this process would seriously jeopardize the Member’ s life, health or ability to 
regain maximum function or in the opinion of his or her Physician would cause severe pain which 
cannot be managed without the requested services; or  
 
b) the appeal involves non- authorization of an admission or continuing inpatient Hospital stay.  
 
If You request that Y our appeal be expedited based on (a) above, Y ou may also ask for an expedited 
external Independent Review at the same time, if the time to complete an expedited internal appeal would 
be detrimental to your medical condition.  
Cigna Healthcare’s Physician reviewer, in consultation with the treating Physician will decide if an expedited 
appeal is necessary. When an appeal is expedited, We will respond orally with a decision within 24 hours, 
followed up in writing.  
Your appeal will be reviewed and the decision made by someone not involved in the initial decision. Appeals 
involving Medical Necessity or clinical appropriateness will be considered by a health care professional.   
 
For expedited appeals, We will notify Y ou within no later than 24 hours your submission, of all information 
required to evaluate Your appeal. We will notify You, Your Primary Care Physician and any health care 
Provider who recommended the health care service involved in the appeal orally with a decision within 24

INDHMOIL c01-2024  Connect Silver CMS Standard

96 will follow. The written notice of determination will include:  
(i) reasons for the determination,  
 
(ii) the medical or clinical criteria for the determination, and  
 
(iii) in the case of an adverse determination, the procedures for requesting an external independent 
review as provided by the Illinois Health Carrier External Review Act.  
 
External Independent Review Procedure  
External Review Procedure 
If You are not fully satis fied with the decision of Cigna Healthcare’ s appeal review regarding medical 
necessity, experimental/investigational, initial eligibility determination, rescission of health coverage, a 
determination of whether You are entitled to a reasonable alternative standard for a reward under a wellness 
program, a determination of whether Y our plan is complying with the non- quantitative treatment limitation 
provisions and parity in the application of medical management techniques consistent with the Mental Health 
Parity and Addiction Equity Act, or if a decis ion on Y our appeal to Cigna Healthcare has been delayed by 
Cigna Healthcare for more than 15 days for concurrent or prospective appeals and 15 calendar  days for 
retrospective appeals, Y ou or Y our authorized representative may request that Your appeal be referred to 
an Independent Review Organization. The Independent Review Organization is composed of persons who 
are not employed by Cigna Healthcare or any of its affiliates. A decision to use the voluntary level of appeal 
will not affect the claimant’s right s to any other benefits under the plan.  
 
There is no charge for Y ou to initiate this independent review process. Cigna Healthcare will abide by the 
decision of the Independent Review Organization.  
 
In order to request a Referral to an Independent Review Organization, certain conditions apply. The reason 
for the denial must be based on a Medical Necessity, experimental/investigational, initial eligibility 
determination or rescission of health coverage  determination by Cigna Healthcare. Administrative or benefit 
coverage limits or exclusions are not eligible for appeal under this process.  
 
To request a review, Y ou must send a written request to the Illinois Department of Insurance within 4 months 
of Your receipt of Cigna Healthcare’ s appeal review denial. You or Y our authorized representative may 
include all relevant documentation and any additional information with your appeal request. The 
Independent Review Organization will render an opinion within 45 days after receiving all necessary 
information. When requested and when determined a delay would be detrimental to your condition, the 
review shall be completed w ithin 72 hours or 5 days for expedited experimental/investigational reviews.  
 
The Independent Review Program is voluntary for Y ou and is arranged by the Illinois Department of 
Insurance.  
Expedited External Review Procedure  
If You have a medical condition where the timeframe for completion of an expedited internal review of a 
grievance involving an adverse determination, a final adverse determination or a standard external review 
would seriously jeopardize Y our life, health or ability to regain maximum function, if a decision on Y our 
Expedited appeal to Cigna Healthcare has been delayed by Cigna Healthcare for more than 48 hours, or it 
has been determined that benefits for treatment services for inpatient and outpatient treatm ent of substance  
Cigna HealthCare of Illinois, Inc.

 MIHM0411 MIHM0412 MIHM0414  
97 use disorders or conditions are no longer medically necessary, then You or Y our authorized representative 
may file a request for an expedited external review.  
 
You may have the right to request an expedited external review of a final adverse determination for the 
following:  
• coverage has been denied due to Cigna Healthcare’s finding that the requested health care service is 
experimental or investigational, and Y our treating physician certifies in writing, and supports the 
certification with evidence that the recommended or requested health care service or treatment would 
be significantly less effective if not promptly initiated;  
• an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care service for which the covered person 
received emergency services, but has not been discharged from a facility ; or 
• within 24 hours following and adverse determination for inpatient and outpatient treatment of 
substance use disorders or conditions.

to show your ID card and pay any applicable Copayment; your Participating Provider will submit a claim to 
Us for reimbursement. Claims for Emergency Services from Non- Participating Providers can be submitted 
by the Provider if the Provider is able and willing to file on your behalf.  If a Non- Participating Provider is not 
submitting on your behalf, you must send your completed claim form and itemized bills to the claim s address 
listed on your ID card.

Claim Determination Procedures Under Federal Law   
(Provisions of the laws of this state may supersede.)  
Procedures Regarding Medical Necessity Determinations  
In general, health services and benefits must be Medically Necessary to be covered under the EOC . The 
procedures for determining medical necessity vary, according to the type of service or benefit requested, 
and the type of health plan. Medical n ecessity determinations are made on either a pre -service, concurrent, 
or post -service basis, as described below.  
Certain services require Prior Authorization in order to be covered. This Prior Authoriz ation is called a “ pre-
service medical necessity determination.”  The EOC  describes who is responsible for obtaining this review. 
The Member  or their authorized representative (typically, their health care Provider) must request medical 
necessity determinations according to the procedures described below, in the  EOC , and in the Member ’s 
Provider’ s network participation documents as applicable.  
When services or benefits are determined to be not Medically Necessary, the Member  or their representative 
will receive a written description of the adverse determination, and may appeal the determination. Appeal 
procedures are described in the EOC , in the Member ’s Provider’ s network participation documents, and in 
the determination notices.  
 
Pre-service Medical Necessity Determinations  
When the Member  or their representative requests a required medical necessity determination prior to care, 
Cigna  Healthcare will notify the Member  or their representative of the determination within 15 days after 
receiving the request. However, if more time is needed due to matters beyond Cigna Healthcare’ s control, 
Cigna  Healthcare will notify the Member  or their representative within 15 days after receiving the request. 
This notice will include the date a determination can be expected, which will be no more than 30 days  after 
receipt of the request. If more time is needed because necessary information is missing from the request, 
the notice will also specify what information is needed, and the Member  or their representative must provide 
the specified information to Us  within 45 days after receiving the notice. The determination period will be  
Cigna HealthCare of Illinois, Inc.  
INDHMOIL c01-2024  Connect Silver CMS Standard  
 MIHM0411 MIHM0412 MIHM0414  
108 suspended on the date Cigna  Healthcare sends such a notice of missing information, and the determination 
period will resume on the date the Member  or their representative responds to the notice.  
If the determination periods above would (a) seriously jeopardize the Member ’s life or health, their ability to 
regain maximum function, or (b) in the opinion of a Physician  with knowledge of the Member ’s health 
condition, cause them severe pain which cannot be managed without the requested services, Cigna  
Healthcare will make the pre -service determination on an expedited basis. Cigna Healthcare’s Physician
